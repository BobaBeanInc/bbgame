## 💡 Tips

- **Lower a boba's HP before collecting** — the less HP it has, the higher your catch chance
- **You start with 5 collection cups** — use them wisely!
- **Your boba earns EXP from every win** and levels up automatically
- **Evolved bobas** are significantly more powerful — prioritize leveling your starters
- **STAB bonus:** If a move's flavor matches your boba's flavor type, it deals 50% extra damage
- **If all your bobas faint**, you'll be sent back to Bean's Boba Bar in Raleigh with everyone healed to half HP
- **Check your party anytime** by clicking the 📋 MENU button or tapping your boba icons
